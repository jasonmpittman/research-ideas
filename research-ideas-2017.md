# Research Ideas - 2017

I am adding seven (new) entries to a research idea brainstorming list each week, over the course of 2017. Each block of research ideas are organized according to a month-week structure. Where a week overlaps between months, if the week is the fourth in the ending month the list update belongs to that month. Otherwise, the overlap serves as the first week in the beginning month.

This content is intended for public use but does represent scholarly work. As such, I feel that a Creative Commons BY-SA license (Attribution + ShareAlike) is attached. 

Thus, I encourage you to use these ideas as springboards for your own research. Quote, mix & match, revise...do whatever you feel inspired to do with the entries. I do ask that if a list entry is *italicized*, please do not use that exact entry in your work. An italicized entry means that I am using the idea.
